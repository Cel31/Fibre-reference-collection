# Fibre reference collection

The reference collection is organized by order to facilitate focusing on plant diversity while keeping plant
properties in perspective (Barrau, 1974). Barrau’s approach (1974) helps to look for great trends into plant
evolution and behavior as seen by Indigenous people and specialized botanists. To do so, pictures of plants
and baskets are presented together to better link how macroscopic and microscopic features come together.
This research aims to document which set of microscopic anatomical features (including phytolith) can
characterize a useful plant and what they are used for. This is a trend in comparative anatomy studies to
show how structure and form could be interrelated biologically (French&Tomlinson, 1986; Hallé, 2005)
that could be also used as an indicator of plant property into archaeobotanical assemblage.

Phytolith plays a role in plant solidity, as most of them are in the epidermis cells consolidating and protect-
ing the plant (Catling&Grayson, 2007). The longest fibers and silica bodies are pushed to the outer layer of
the plant because they could not have other use than protecting the vascular system and especially the phlo-
em of the living plant. The phytoliths cast in stigmata cells, that are in epidermal or hypodermal cells and
close by vascular system.
